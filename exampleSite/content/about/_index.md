Hello Lovies! I'm Kimberly Cherry and today's about me page is brought to you by Mattman! Mattman, bringing you working websites everywhere to anyone who is at all interested in his wife (that sounds weird) and her multifaceted artistic ventures and collecting habits that often morph into artdolls and other such chaos!

I am a fourty-something, very mostly empty-nesting mother of two brilliant young men. I should brag on them more often, but not being given much to bragging I typically just stand by nodding my head sagely as others brag on them for me. 

I have been an artist of some caliber for most of my life. I've also been happily married for most of my life, too... Actually, I'm coming up on two thirds of my life! I think, maybe, I'm really bad at math. We've been married a long time. Over 25 years, actually. This makes me feel kinda old, but it's true, nonetheless.

But, art! Yeah, I like it a lot. And I like to collect stuff, too, mostly toys. Dolls and My Little Pony. Smartdolls currently own me, it's true. Hopefully you see will more art here and less collection here. But, I like my collections alot, too. So, no promises.

Anyways, thanks for checking out the site. This may get more professional at some point but for now I'd rather make fun of myself, my husband and frankly the whole world. So, Nyyah!! Later tater!!
